# Fashion Image Generation with GANs

![Generated Fashion Images](output.png)

## Overview

This project focuses on training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate realistic fashion images using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The GAN architecture includes a generator and discriminator, and the project aims to achieve high-quality image generation and explore potential applications in fashion design and e-commerce.


## Project Description

This project leverages deep learning and GANs to generate fashion images, contributing to the intersection of AI and fashion. The key components include data preprocessing, GAN architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation. The generated images can potentially find applications in fashion design, e-commerce, and creative content generation.

## Key Features

- **GAN Architecture:** Utilizes a GAN architecture with a generator and discriminator.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes data scaling, augmentation, and preparation from the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizes hyperparameters to achieve the best image generation quality.
- **Monitoring and Visualization:** Monitors training progress and visualizes loss curves and sample images.
